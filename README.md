# Predicting Poverty

This project delves into the application and capabilities of machine learning methodologies in forecasting poverty scenarios, underlining the importance of varied data sources, along with the interpretability and explainability of models to refine the precision and transparency of poverty prediction mechanisms. It primarily utilizes an iteration of the LightGBM algorithm to infer poverty stages premised on household variables. This investigation showcases the potential of machine learning methodologies in poverty estimation, elucidating the relevance of additional, diverse data resources, and the critical role of model interpretability and explainability in enhancing model accuracy and clarity. The LightGBM version employed in our study demonstrated high efficiency on the validation set and an accuracy of 96% in classification, affirming its effectiveness in projecting poverty conditions based on household features.
